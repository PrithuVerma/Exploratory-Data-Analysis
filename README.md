# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository is dedicated to performing **Exploratory Data Analysis** on various datasets to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights before building machine learning models or applying statistical methods.  

---

## 📌 What is EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of **summarizing, visualizing, and understanding data** to identify trends, anomalies, and potential features for modeling.  
It’s a crucial step in any data science project to ensure we **know our data before applying algorithms**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Plotly** – Interactive visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis environment

---

## 📊 EDA Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Loading** – Import datasets from CSV, Excel, or APIs.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, duplicates, and data type issues.
3. **Descriptive Statistics** – Use `.describe()` and summary metrics.
4. **Data Visualization** – Understand distribution and relationships through plots.
5. **Correlation Analysis** – Identify relationships between features.
6. **Outlier Detection** – Spot and address unusual data points.
7. **Feature Understanding** – Prepare for feature engineering.

## 📈 Example Outputs
- Histograms for feature distribution
- Scatter plots for relationship analysis
- Heatmaps for correlation
- Boxplots for outlier detection
- Interactive dashboards for deeper exploration
